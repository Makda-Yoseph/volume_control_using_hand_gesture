## Project Overview

This project offers an innovative, contact-free way to control the system volume. By analyzing hand gestures in real-time, the application adjusts the volume based on the distance between specific points on the hand (e.g., thumb and index finger). The project provides an interactive and accessible approach to volume control, especially in hands-free environments.

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture recognition for volume control
- Dynamic mapping of finger distance to adjust volume
- Smooth and responsive volume transitions
- Works under various lighting conditions
- Minimal lag for a seamless user experience

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **OpenCV**: For video capture and image processing
- **MediaPipe**: Pre-trained hand detection model for real-time hand landmark tracking
- **Pycaw** (or similar): For system audio control

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gesture-control-volume
